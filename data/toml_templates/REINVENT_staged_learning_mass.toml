# REINVENT4 TOML input example for reinforcement/curriculum learning
#
#
# Curriculum learning in REINVENT4 is a multi-stage reinforcement learning
# run.  One or more stages (auto CL) can be defined.  But it is also
# possible to continue a run from any checkpoint file that is generated
# during the run (manual CL).  Currently checkpoints are written at the end
# of a run also when the run is forcefully terminated with Ctrl-C.

[parameters]

# Uncomment one of the comment blocks below.  Each generator needs a model
# file and possibly a SMILES file with seed structures.  If the run is to
# be continued after termination, the agent_file would have to be replaced
# with the checkpoint file.
